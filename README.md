# Description
 A Snakemake workflow designed to analyse single-cell data from cellranger count output. The workflow expects the cellranger count output which contains per sample bc_matrix (raw and filtered) under the `~/sample_name/outs` folder. For more information please refer [cellranger ouput](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/analysis/outputs/cr-outputs-gex-overview)
 
The general steps are as follows:
All the steps are carried out using [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/get_started_v5_new>)
 * Preprocessing 
 * Clustering and dimensional reduction
 * Marker identification 
 * Assigning cell types to clusters (Automate cell type assignment using marker genes)
 * Integrative analysis
 * Default differential expression tests across models 
 * Differential expression across samples within the same cell types
 * Gene Ontology analysis using clusterProfiler [clusterProfiler](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html)
 * Pathway enrichment analysis using clusterProfiler
